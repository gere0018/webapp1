        <h2>App 1</h2>
        <p>This App is a a web app designed from scratch using only html5 css and javaScript without the help of any framework like bootstrap or libraries like JQuery or JQuery mobile. It's an opportunity to review all the concepts studed so far and to practice single page applications in html. Most importantly the Cordova phone gap is used again to allow us to make the app fucntional on Android.</p>
